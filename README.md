# JezzBall
A JezzBall game made in asm x86

## How to Play
The player has to capture as much space as possible in the time limit.  
To do that, the player can click __Left Click__ to create a vertical wall, and __Right Click__ to create an horizonal wall.  
There are balls bouncing off the walls. If a ball hits a wall that is yet to complete, the wall will break, and the player will lose a life.  
If a wall completes, every area without a ball next to it will become a boundary.  
After the player capture 65% of the area he will move to the next level with an extra ball.

## Requirements
An x86 emulator (I used DosBox)
